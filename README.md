# WrathCombo.API

WrathCombo.API provides the enum and similar data
used by [Wrath Combo's](https://github.com/PunishXIV/WrathCombo) IPC (read: API), and
(eventually) also the IPC Methods themselves.\
All in the sake of not having to copy over
signatures, data, or keep up with the IPC changelog
yourself.

You can find the full documentation for the IPC
itself [here](https://github.com/PunishXIV/WrathCombo/blob/main/docs/IPC.md).

## Support

It's best to open issues here; but opening issue posts in the
[puni.sh discord server](https://discord.gg/Zzrcc8kmvy)'s
[Wrath Issues Forum](https://discord.com/channels/1001823907193552978/1271175826246865026)
(with `[API]` in the title) is also fine.

## Changes

See [Docs/Changes.md](/Docs/Changes.md) for a changelog.
